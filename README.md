1. Backend Setup: To set up the backend, navigate to the backend directory and use Docker Compose to build and run the project:

```
// Download the .env file and shift it to the flask-server folder
We need this .env to get the variables needed to by the compose.yaml

// You should be in Spick/backend
cd backend
docker-compose up --build
```

1. Frontend Setup: Open a new terminal window or tab for the frontend setup. Navigate to the frontend directory, install the necessary packages, and start the development server:

```
// You should be in Spick/frontend/
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
